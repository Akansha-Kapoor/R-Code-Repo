## R Code Repo

This is a repository to store all my R code generated during the Data Science course on Coursera. 
The purpose of this is to backup all the files that are created. 
This can be used if needed, though there may be mistakes in the code. The code may also be inefficient in several cases as I am just starting out in the the language.
